## Grab data from RSS

Here is a handy website that transforms rss feed into json, and provides a API for that: http://rss2json.com/. For example, my blog's rss feed being transformed to json is: http://rss2json.com/api.json?rss_url=http%3A%2F%2Fchocoluffy.com%2Fatom.xml. Then using this json file, we can have a much more consistent and clear structure to formatize into RN app.
